Welcome to the Blade-Racer wiki!

This is my first game project inspired by old school pseudo 3d technique and my favorite movie Blade Runner.

[https://1a2b3c4dboban.github.io/Blade-Racer/](Sit tight!)

## Functionality & MVP

This game could give use the arcade playing experience online.
In Blade Racer, user can:

- [ ] Control the car with keyboard
- [ ] Browse the amazing retro future city
- [ ] Experience different road geometry

And these functionalities would need me to:

- [ ] revise some trigonometry
- [ ] revise basic 3d projection
- [ ] build a game loop
- [ ] load some sprite images
- [ ] build some road geometry
- [ ] render the background
- [ ] render the road
- [ ] render the car
- [ ] enable keyboard support to drive the car
- [ ] Parts of the descriptions come from Code in Complete

## Wireframes

This app will consist a full-screen canvas displaying everything within.

Above is the game start wireframe, only with game start button and mute sound button.

## Architecture and Technologies

This project will implement with the following technologies:

* Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic,
* HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering,
* Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

In addition to the webpack entry file, there will be following scripts involved in the project.
* minimalist DOM helpers
* general purpose helpers
* POLYFILL for requestAnimationFrame
* GAME LOOP helpers
* canvas rendering helpers
* RACING GAME CONSTANTS
